you are required to create a data processing plateform for client that will ingest , process and analyze customer identification data in batch and real time mode. The system must support -
Real time ingestion for data-from pub sub(write python code for data tranformation and processing)
Batch reconciallation Job
config driven code execution
Full infra automation using terraform.
Batch dataflow will be triggered via composer DAG and will mask the data customer data in bq.
Deliverables:
Source code for streaming and batch pipelines.
Terraform code for infra setup.
CICD pipeline
